# Introduction 

The NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) serves as a vital infrastructure supporting the sharing, integration, and usability of biomedical data across a diverse range of research areas. By fostering interoperability and collaboration, the CFDE addresses the growing need for efficient data access and reuse, enabling scientists to tackle pressing questions in biomedicine.  

The CFDE comprises five core centers, each focused on a specific aspect of the ecosystem’s development and operation, and a network of data coordinating centers (DCCs) representing specific research domains. These DCCs bring together rich datasets, tools, and expertise, creating a foundation for interdisciplinary collaboration. To expand its reach and capabilities, the CFDE has also funded a series of strategic partnerships with external organizations and projects, enhancing the ecosystem’s capacity to meet evolving research needs.  

In addition to these structural components, CFDE supports a variety of cross-cutting activities. These include meetings, workshops, and webinars designed to facilitate knowledge exchange, foster community engagement, and drive the ecosystem’s growth. Collectively, these elements form a dynamic and adaptable framework for advancing biomedical research.  

This report provides an analysis of the CFDE through the lens of metrics and data, structured into four sections:  

1. **Centers**: This section examines the contributions of the five CFDE centers, focusing on their individual roles and collective impact on the ecosystem’s goals.  
2. **Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs)**: Here, we analyze the role of DCCs in curating and providing access to high-value datasets and their interactions with the broader CFDE framework. 
3. **Partnerships**: This section highlights the impact of CFDE-funded partnerships, emphasizing their role in expanding the ecosystem’s scope and capacity.  
4. **Cross-Cutting Activities**: Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of meetings, workshops, and webinars in promoting community engagement and supporting ecosystem objectives.  

This structure ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the CFDE’s multifaceted components, capturing their distinct contributions while addressing their interdependencies. By organizing the report in this way, we aim to provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the ecosystem’s achievements and opportunities for future growth.
